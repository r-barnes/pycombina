class CombinaMILP():

    '''
    Solve a binary approximation problem by combinatorial integral approximation
    using mixed-integer linear programming and Gurobi.

    The following options of :class:`pycombina.BinApprox` are supported:

    - Maximum number of switches
    - Minimum up-times
    - Minimum down-times
    - Valid control transitions (b_adjacencies)
    - Valid controls per interval (b_valid)
    - Active control at time point t_0-1 (b_bin_pre)

    All other options are ignored without further notice.
